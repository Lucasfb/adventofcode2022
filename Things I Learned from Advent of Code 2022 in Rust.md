## Day 1
* Implement ordering traits
* Apply function (parsing) to all elements of vector
* (Remind) Parse string to number
* (Remind) Access elements of vector from the end instead of beginning
* (fasterthanli.me) fs-err and colour-eyre crates
* (nightly) take() method for vectors
## Day 2
* A string with a single character gets converted to 'char' instead of '&str' with split()
* Removing elements from vector gives an Option that needs to be handled
* Implementing try_from() and from_str(), to parse structs we create
* The matches! macro
* Collecting a vector as a trick to avoid dealing with Result
